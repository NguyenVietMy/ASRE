# context

Before performing any action, you must fully read and absorb the entire project documentation. This includes:

- All `.md` files in the repository
- Everything inside the `/docs` directory (including nested folders)
- All README files, regardless of directory or file naming style (README.md, readme.md, ReadMe.md, etc.)

Use this collected documentation to understand:

- The project’s complete scope
- Architectural decisions
- Naming conventions
- Requirements and constraints
- Existing patterns and expected behavior

Do not generate code, propose solutions, or make decisions until you have integrated this full project context. If anything appears missing or ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Always align your decisions with the documentation you’ve just read.
